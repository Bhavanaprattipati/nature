  <h1>NATURE</h1>
  <p>“Nature” is more than just a word for plants, animals, and habitats. She is a complex living organism that produces and nurtures life. That’s why we call her “Mother Nature.” We may view ourselves as separate from Nature, especially when we use words like “man-made” to describe something that is NOT natural. But this notion is far from the truth.
